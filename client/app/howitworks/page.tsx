            Stakcast is a decentralized prediction market platform where users
            can create, trade, and resolve markets. Leveraging the power of
            StarkNet for scalability and security, Stakcast ensures seamless
            user experiences while maintaining a trustless environment.

              1. Create or Join a Market
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
              Users can create prediction markets by defining a question,
              setting an expiration date, and providing initial liquidity.
              Alternatively, you can explore and participate in markets created
              by others.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
              Stakcast enables real-time trading on markets, allowing users to
              buy and sell positions based on their predictions. The prices
              dynamically adjust based on supply and demand, reflecting the
              probability of each outcome.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
              Once a market expires, Stakcast utilizes Atoma’s agents and TEEs
              to validate the outcome. These agents collect data from trusted
              sources and securely process it within a TEE, ensuring the results
              are tamper-proof and verifiable.

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
              After the market outcome is validated, rewards are distributed
              proportionally to the users based on their staked positions. The
              entire process is trustless and executed via smart contracts
              deployed on StarkNet.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
            Atoma provides a powerful framework for creating decentralized
            agents that utilize Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These
            TEEs ensure that sensitive computations, such as market outcome
            validation, are conducted securely and transparently. By integrating
            Atoma, Stakcast achieves:
