# Security Considerations for Stakcast

This document outlines security risks, mitigations, and emergency procedures for Stakcast protocol.

---

Risks to be addressed
- **Reentrancy Attacks**
    Mitigated using checks-effects-interactions and non-reentrant patterns.
- **Oracle Manipulation**
    Using decentralized, delay-tolerant price feeds where applicable.
- **Flash Loan Exploits**
    To prevent manipulation in a single block, use sensitive logic includes sanity checks
- **Access Control Misuse**
    Enforcing role-based access using Cairo's permission checks.

---

## Mitigattion
- Perform internal audits before deploying.
- Use battle-tested libraries and Cairo standards.
- Confirm with **multisig** to govern and upgrage actions.
- Prevent unsafe code from merging using husky hooks to enforce linting.

---

## Emergency Procedures
- **Pause Functionality** : Include pause/unpause functionalities for critical functions.
- **Governance Actions**: If necessary, emergency proposals can disable deposits or withdrawals.
- **Upgrads**: Use strict governance approval for protocol using upgradeable patterns.

---
## Security Best Practices for Integrators
- Validate return values.
- Without verifying signatures, avoid trusting off-chain services.
- Monitor events for anomalies.
- Do not expose private keys in '.env' files or frontend code.
