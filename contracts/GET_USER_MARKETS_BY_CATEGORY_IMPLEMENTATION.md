# get_user_markets_by_category Function Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the `get_user_markets_by_category` function that allows filtering a user's participated markets by category.

## Function Signature

```cairo
fn get_user_markets_by_category(
    self: @TContractState,
    user: ContractAddress,
    category: u8
) -> Array<PredictionMarket>
```

## Parameters

- `user`: The contract address of the user whose markets we want to filter
- `category`: The category to filter by (0-7, corresponding to MarketCategory enum)

## Return Value

- Returns an `Array<PredictionMarket>` containing all markets the user has participated in that match the specified category

## Implementation Details

### 1. Input Validation

```cairo
assert(category <= 7, 'Invalid category: must be 0-7');
```

- Validates that the category parameter is within the valid range (0-7)

### 2. Category Mapping

The function uses the existing `num_to_market_category` helper function to convert the numeric category to the `MarketCategory` enum:

- 0 → Normal
- 1 → Politics
- 2 → Sports
- 3 → Crypto
- 4 → Business
- 5 → Entertainment
- 6 → Science
- 7 → Other

### 3. Market Filtering Logic

```cairo
let user_market_ids = self.user_predictions.entry(user);
let user_market_ids_len = user_market_ids.len();

for i in 0..user_market_ids_len {
    let market_id: u256 = user_market_ids.at(i).read();
    let market = self.all_predictions.entry(market_id).read();

    // Check if market category matches the requested category
    if market.category == num_to_market_category(category) {
        user_markets.append(market);
    }
}
```

### 4. Storage Access Pattern

- Uses `self.user_predictions.entry(user)` to get all market IDs the user has participated in
- Iterates through each market ID and retrieves the full market data from `self.all_predictions`
- Compares the market's category with the requested category using the `num_to_market_category` helper
- Appends matching markets to the result array

## Usage Examples

### Get all Sports markets for a user

```cairo
let sports_markets = contract.get_user_markets_by_category(user_address, 2);
```

### Get all Crypto markets for a user

```cairo
let crypto_markets = contract.get_user_markets_by_category(user_address, 3);
```

### Get all Politics markets for a user

```cairo
let politics_markets = contract.get_user_markets_by_category(user_address, 1);
```

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Category**: If category > 7, the function will panic with "Invalid category: must be 0-7"
- **User Not Found**: If the user has no participated markets, returns an empty array
- **Category Not Found**: If the user has no markets in the specified category, returns an empty array

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of markets the user has participated in
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of markets matching the category
- The function iterates through all user markets, so performance depends on user participation level

## Integration Points

- **Interface**: Added to `IPredictionHub` interface in `interface.cairo`
- **Implementation**: Added to `PredictionHub` contract in `prediction.cairo`
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `num_to_market_category` helper function from `types.cairo`
- **Storage**: Reads from `user_predictions` and `all_predictions` storage maps

## Testing Status

- ✅ Contract compiles successfully
- ✅ Function signature matches interface
- ✅ Implementation follows existing patterns
- ⚠️ Test files have compilation issues (unrelated to this implementation)

## Related Functions

- `get_all_bets_for_user`: Returns all markets a user has participated in (no category filter)
- `get_user_market_ids`: Returns just the market IDs for a user
- `get_active_prediction_markets`: Returns all active markets (no user filter)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add batch category filtering (multiple categories at once)
2. Add pagination support for users with many markets
3. Add sorting options (by creation date, end date, etc.)
4. Add market status filtering (active, resolved, closed)
